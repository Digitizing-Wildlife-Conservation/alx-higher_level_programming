0x11. Python - Network #1 Python Scripting Back-end API Cohort

The "0x11. Python - Network #1" project, led by Moses Muchai,Up-coming CTO-ALX SE-Software Engineering Student Mastercard Foundation at Holberton School,
focuses on enhancing Python skills related to network interactions.
The learning objectives include understanding how to fetch internet resources using the urllib package, decoding urllib body responses, using the requests
package for making HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.), and manipulating data from external services. The project specifies requirements such as using specific
editors, Python version, file endings, and the inclusion of README.md files. Tasks involve writing Python scripts using urllib and requests to perform actions
like fetching the status of a URL, extracting response headers, sending POST requests with parameters, handling HTTP errors, and interacting with the GitHub API
to retrieve commit information. Each script adheres to specific guidelines and is tested using a provided sandbox environment.
